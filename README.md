# CodeIgniter-Easy-Menu-Manager
A library to manage menus of your web application with codeigniter. The library requires one controller, one model, one view and depends on nestle.js for nesting features.

It supports upto 4 levels of submenus per each menu but you can easily increase that by altering the codes in the controller and the model.

This library is done for my private project and hope it helps someone out!
